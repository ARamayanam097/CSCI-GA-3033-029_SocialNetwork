## Abstract
```
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a significant change in the release and consumption of movies. 
Although online streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and AppleTV have been in existence 
\for over a decade, they have experienced a surge in popularity. The lockdowns in 2020 made these 
platforms the primary focus of audiences, providing them with a contemporary way of watching feature films. 
The excitement of watching new releases directly on these platforms and the nostalgic feeling that older, 
beloved movies evoke has attracted people in large numbers. However, this does not necessarily imply that 
online streaming platforms will replace movie theaters, as our survey-based findings suggest otherwise. 
Additionally, the study highlights that although the mode of consuming movies may evolve, their ability to 
elicit emotions remains timeless.
